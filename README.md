# IansCodeRepository
Code for Transportation related projects
I used this code in PostgreS (SQL)
This code was created for a class project. The code identifies key bus stop on frequent high density routes in the MBTA system and creates a buffer zone around them
I then pulled the the result into Qgis to create maps of the buffer zone, which I intersected with BlockgroupData from the US Census bureau in order to calculate the population within the buffer zone.
The results produced figures for the coverage of key bus stops and accessibility for those close enough to walk to a high frequency bus stop on the MBTA system
